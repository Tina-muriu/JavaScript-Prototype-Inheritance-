# JavaScript Prototype Inheritance Example

This repository contains a JavaScript code example that demonstrates prototype inheritance in JavaScript. It includes a parent constructor function, `TheParent`, and a child constructor function, `TheChild`, which inherits from `TheParent` using the `inherit` function. 

## Code Overview

- `TheParent`: The parent constructor function with a `name` property and a `print` method.
- `TheChild`: The child constructor function that inherits from `TheParent` and adds a unique `lastname` property.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JavaScript-Prototype-Inheritance.git
   ```

2. Open the HTML file in your browser to run the code.

## Concept Covered

- Prototype-based inheritance in JavaScript.
